# TYPO3 Kickstart Extension

This is a minimal TYPO3 extension for creating new extensions using `composer create-project`. It only contains the bare minimum required for an extension in a composer managed installation.

It is essentially a collection of files, I didn't want to copy again and again.

## Usage

Run `composer create-project grossberger-georg/kickstart-extension my_ext`. The installer will ask a few questions to set things up.
